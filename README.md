## Project Objectives

1. Booking Trends: Identify whether hotels gain more revenue and bookings on weekdays or weekends.
2. Room Occupancy: Determine the occupancy percentage of business versus luxury room categories.
3. Key Metrics Analysis: Display trends for key metrics such as RevPAR, ADR, and occupancy percentage on a weekly basis.
4. Identifying Areas for Improvement: Analyze which aspects of the hotel's operations require enhancement to increase profitability.
   
## Datasets

This project includes both raw and transformed datasets. The raw data required cleaning and transitioning, which was accomplished using Power Query Editor.

## Key Steps

To format the raw data, the following steps were performed in Power Query Editor:
1. Cleaned the datasets and removed unnecessary values.
2. Added a new column to differentiate weekdays and weekends based on date values.
3. Calculated new DAX measures, including RevPAR, occupancy, ADR, DSRN, DURN, WOW%, cancellation percentage, and realization percentage.
4. Created separate graphs for each key metric with tooltips for additional details.
5. Added an explanatory bar at the bottom of the dashboard to provide descriptions for all measures.

## Final Dashboard Results

**Occupancy Percentage:** Analysis revealed higher occupancy on weekends, with an occupancy rate of 62.64% and revenue percentage of 70.6%.

**Room Category Booking:** Business category rooms had a higher booking rate (58%) compared to luxury category rooms.

**Average Daily Rate (ADR):** ADR values remained consistent across weeks, indicating no significant offers, price reductions, or promotions. This suggests a need for increased marketing efforts to boost revenue and attract more customers.
